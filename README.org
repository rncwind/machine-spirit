* What is this?
Machine Spirit is a tool designed to simulate matchups in 9th edition Warhammer
40k.

In the past, I have used ad-hoc back of the envelope methods which include a
bunch of R scripts and python oneliners to do this, and it was starting to get
tiresome.

Initially, this project started out in F# as an exercise for learning that,
however I could not get any database libraries to play nicely with my esoteric
system setup, as such I moved to rust.
* Why should I use this?
Oftentimes it's useful to simulate a given matchup. The numbers are often
crunched in terms of MEQs, TEQs and GEQs but sometimes you want to see just how
lucky you need to be in order to kill a titan with a Melta.

This tool is also possibly useful for competitive 40k, but this is not my area
of expertise.
* Shortcomings
Right now, there is no pretty graphical output, and there is no support for
weapon, or character abilities.

Hopefully these will come in due course.
